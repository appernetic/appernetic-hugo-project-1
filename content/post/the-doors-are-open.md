# The doors are open!
We have been working around the clock to have our e-shop working, get an instruction video ready and build  a nicer front page. We hope we have managed to do that, you will be our judge.
 
## Static website generators and Snipcart
We built our website with our favorite website builder Appernetic.io that use the static website generator Hugo. To make the e-shop we have used Snipcart.com. We did some stupid newbie mistakes with the api key, but after that everything worked out very smooth.  

## Instructions video shooting at AirBnB
Today we shoot the instruction video at an AirBnB host. Our goal was to do it as fast as possible with minimal cost. So I used my Sony Xperia and did the recording with the help of my co-worker Jan. We did a little storyboard and then get to work. After 2 hours we had all the clips, had directed it in iMovie and added some text.



So here is the result:
