# The doors are open!
We have been working around the clock to have our e-shop working, get an instruction video ready and build  a nicer front page. We hope we have managed to do that, you will be our judge.
 
## Static website generators and Snipcart
We built our website with our favorite website builder Appernetic that use the static website generator Hugo. To make the e-shop we have used Snipcart.com. We did some stupid newbie mistake with the api key, but after that everything worked out very smooth.  

Today we shoot the instruction video. Our goal was to do it as fast as possible with minimal cost. So I used my Sony Xperia and did the recording with the help of my co-worker Jan. We did a little storyboard and then get to work. After 2 hours we had all the clips, had directed it in iMovie and added some text.

So here is the result:
