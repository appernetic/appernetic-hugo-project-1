# GoWi.Fi
###  GoWI.FI is the easiest way to instantly get WI-FI settings configured in your user's mobile devices.
The user doesn't have to enter any SSID and password which gives the following advantages:

 - Your staff don't have to hand out passwords to visitors which saves time,
 - Users can't enter the wrong password
 - You can use very long passwords which are safer
 - You don't have to use WPS which shouldn't be used anyway,
 - The board can be designed as you want
